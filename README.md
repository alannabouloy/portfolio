<h1>My Professional Portfolio</hi>
<hr>
<h2> About the Page</h2>
<p>This project is my own professional portfolio as a software developer. It started as an assignment for my Thinkful Software Engineering program but I'll be adding to it as time goes by to try and make it as polished as possible. I'll also be updating the page with projects that I've worked on.</p>
<h2>What You Can Find</h2>
<p>Currently the site is a single page with four sections and a menu at the top and bottom that links to each section.</p>
<h4>Sections</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Intro</li>
  <li>About Me</li>
  <li>DnD Character Generator</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intro Section</h3>
<p>This section is a basic welcome message, greeting the reader and giving some basic personal information about me: where I'm from, what I do for fun, etc. It also includes a photo of me.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>This section is a brief bio about my experience as a software developer. It will include my background in coding and eventually links to projects that I've worked on and my professional history.</p>

<h3>My DnD Character Generator</h3>
<p>This section is a fun extra that I threw in both to give a bit of personality to the site, and also to show off a little of my coding skills. I coded a basic Character Generator that you can find in the script.js file of this repository. The Generator takes in a user's Character Name and then returns some basic, randomly generated information about that character that's been taken from the handbook of DnD: Race, Class, and Background. I've only included options that can be found in the basic player handbook, but eventually I want to expand this to a full generator that essentially builds a starting character sheet for players new to the game, or who might be overwhelmed witht the options available to them.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>This is the last section of the site and it offers several links that a person can use to get in touch with me, including links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, an Twitter, as well as a basic email link. Eventually I may add a place where people can sign up to a mailing list, but that's farther down the road.</p>
